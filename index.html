				<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Welcome! My name is Amar Al-Zubaidi and this is my website for Harvard’s CS50. I was born in Baghdad, Iraq in 2006 and
					have since moved to Canada. I am interested in various subjects such as computer science, typography, literature,
					legislation, and history. My favourite programming languages are C, R, shell, Lua. My favourite markup languages are R
					Markdown, Markdown, LaTeX, HTML, CSS. I prefer minimal software over complex software for various reasons. I use
					software that follows the Unix philosophy.
				</p>
				<h2 id="design">Design </h2>
				<p>
					This website was designed with minimalism in mind. I like to
					make my website look like a LaTeX document. LaTeX is a
					document typesetting system which is the industry standard
					for academic textbooks. I want my website to look and feel
					just like a book. I recommend
					<a href="javascript:window.print();">printing</a> it. It has
					a cream background colour, monospace (or typewrite) font
					family for code and URLs, and a lack of colours except for
					the background.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each of these decisions seem unconventional but there are
					very good reasons for them. First, white backgrounds are
					stressful for the human eye, leading a large group of people
					to believe that the solution for this is a dark theme.
					However, since I believe black text looks better than white
					text, I am using a cream background colour which is easy on
					the eyes. Second, URLs should <i>always</i> be in monospace.
					Replacing monospace with an underline is blasphemy. Most
					professional typographers avoid using underlines as much as
					possible because they are just ugly. I do not colour my URLs
					or inline code. This is to make them blend in with the text
					instead of distracting readers. You can still easily tell
					that what they are.
				</p>
				<p>
					It also uses the default serif font for the web browser.
					Serif fonts have been scientifically and statistically
					proven to be easier to read than sans-serif fonts. If you do
					not believe me, open any novel on your bookshelf and check
					to see what the font and text justification looks like.
					Since font choice is extremely personal, this website uses
					the default fonts for the web browser. However, I strongly
					recommend the Computer Modern family of fonts—the font I use
					is Latin Modern. Please excuse the low-resolution image
					below.
