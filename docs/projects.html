					Cfetch is a simple command-line utility that fetches
					information about your operating system. This includes the
					name of your operating system, its kernel, the host, uptime,
					packages installed, shell, terminal, CPU, GPU, and memory.
					It is written in C instead of Bash, unlike Neofetch. This
					results in a much faster program.

					This repository is only useful for people who use the Gentoo
					operating system. Otherwise, you should skip this section or
					install Gentoo first. It is simply an overlay that provides
					packages for software not included in the main Gentoo
					package repository. I have not updated this in a long time
					and there are some improvements to be made. However, it
					includes software not seen in any other Gentoo overlay.

				<dd>
					This R package is great for R Markdown users. If you like
					typesetting documents in R Markdown, you will notice that
					sometimes you have to do things for every single document
					you create. This is repetitive, tedious, and unnecessary.
					AmaRYAML provides a few templates that will prevent you from
					needing to do this.

				<dt><a href="https://github.com/amarakon/dfm">DFM</a></dt>
				<dd>
					This is probably my biggest project so far. DFM is a simple
					file manager written in pure POSIX shell. Unfortunately, you
					will only be able to run this program on a Unix-like
					operating system such as a BSD, GNU, or macOS. It is heavily
					keyboard-based, making it a good option for people who are
					excellent at typing.

				<dd>
					Most people use OBS to record videos. OBS is an excellent
					piece of free software. However, it is undeniably bloated.
					You can record with just plain FFmpeg. But FFmpeg is
					difficult to use, making it an unpleasent option for
					normies. FFrec’s job is to make FFmpeg easier to use as it
					is a wrapper for FFmpeg.
				</dd>
				<dt><a href="https://github.com/amarakon/magickshot">MagickShot</a></dt>
				<dd>
					MagickShot is like FFrec but for taking screenshots instead
					of recording videos. ImageMagick, like FFmpeg, is an
					excellent piece of software for converting images and taking
					screenshots. But just like FFmpeg, it is not very
					user-friendly. MagickShot makes it stupidly easy to
					screenshot a selection, window, monitor, or display. It’s
					just like magic!
